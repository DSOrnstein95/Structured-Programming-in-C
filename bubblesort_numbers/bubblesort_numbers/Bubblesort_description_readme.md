# Description Bubblesort_numbers
This C-program firstly prompts the user to enter 10 negative or positive integers. Secondly the values entered are shown in an unsorted, tabular and ascending format. 
By applying the bubblesort function the entered values are passed by reference and as a result the content of the arguments (whom are binary values allocated in an array of memory addresses). The address contents are then compared and will be swapped if the first number in the array is greater than the second one and continues so on, until there is nothing left to sort.
