# Description Bubblesort_numbers
This C-program firstly prompts the user to enter 10 negative or positive integers. Secondly the values entered are shown in an unsorted, tabular and ascending format 
By applying the bubblesort function the entered values are passed by reference and as a result the content of the arguments (whom are memory addresses) can easily be manipulated
with the objective to sort the input values. Then the numbers are shown in the same arrangement as previous, however the values will be sorted from lowest to highest value.
