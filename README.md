# Structured-Programming-in-C
This repository contains C-programs that were designed by me when i was in my first year of the Electrical Engineering program at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. These assignments were designed to put your knowledge to the test, so each program deals with important C-subjects, such as conditional or non-conditional loops, functions and function scope, pointers and structures. Furthermore topics like passing Command Line arguments and file handling (I/O) (as arguments to main) of a C-program were also dealt with.
