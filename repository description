# Structured-Programming-in-C
This repository contains C-programs that were designed by me when i was introduced to the 
C-programing language during my first year of the Electrical and Electronics Engineering program at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. The C-programs were designed in CodeBlocks but could easily be compiled in other environments such as Visual Studio or OnlineGDB.
